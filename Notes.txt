supervised learning
    we'll be having labels and based on that we predict the outcome -> regression and classification .

1.regression house price prediction-> take in multiple values and then we map it on a graph
    based on this graph we predict the outcome of the data 
2. classification -> it's a either yes or no question 
    if there are more than 2 categories we use classification based on categories based on parameters
    as we add more parameters the model goes complex
    therefore usage of multiple parameters is always useful

un-supervised learning
    the data is'nt labelled therefore we don't know what should be done, therefore we won't be having any parameters -> categorization
    1.in unsupervised we group the data which are similar and classfy them as group 1 and etc.. 

    data only comes with input x and we dont have output labels y, hence algorithim has to find structure in the data

    -> clustering
    -> dimensionality reduction

linear regression model is all about minimizing the cost error by using linear regression function and finding the lowest part of the graph
